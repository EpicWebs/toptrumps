# A WordPress Top Trumps Game
This is a game created in WordPress, it uses ACF Pro to manage the fields in the admin area, but this could easily be custom built instead. Most of the logic works off of Javascript/jQuery and some PHP for fetching card data.

## How to play!

- Refresh/Load the page.
- Click a trait/skill on the card to compare it against the opponents card.
- The opponent will then automatically select their skill/trait to compare to yours.
- After all the cards have gone, the person with the most points wins.

## How to add cards.

- Login to the admin area.
- Click the cards custom post type on the left hand side.
- Click add new and fill in the fields.
- Click publish and the card will be in the game!

## List of future improvements

- Make the game rely on a plugin instead of a theme.
- Add more animations to make it feel like the cards are battling.
- Add additional cards via the admin area.
- Add a computer AI that randomly selects a skill after you have selected a skill.
- Open up the API endpoints so that the data could be used for an app or some other front end.

_When refreshing the page a new game will be created._
